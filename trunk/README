== Authorization hooks

Few hooks for dealing with authorization.

C stands for controller, H for helper.

=== Added methods

* C: reset_user_session - reset session (does this if session has been 
tampered with).
* C: save_last_location - save last location user was (unless it's defined 
not to be saved, look @ Configuration).
* C: renew_session - update session cookie expiration date to be 
session[:expires_in] from now.
* C: check_authorization - checks if authorized, saves location if not and 
redirects to login page.
* C, H: authorized? - true/false. Is user authorized? User is authorized if 
session[:authorized] evaluates to true.

=== Configuration

Set variables in your environment.rb like this:

AuthorizationHoos.reset_user_session_message = 'foobar!'

Look into lib/authorization_hooks.rb for options.
